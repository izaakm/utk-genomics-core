# UTK Genomics Core Sequencing data

**Methods**

Please contact the genomics at <genomicscore@utk.edu> for specific information
on library prep and instrument set up methods. 


Fastq files were generated with the Illumina BCL Convert(tm) software, which
converts the Binary Base Call (BCL) files produced by Illumina(tm) instruments
to FASTQ files. The BCL Convert [support pages](https://support.illumina.com)
provide additional resources. These resources include training, compatible
products, and other considerations. Always check support pages for the latest
versions.
