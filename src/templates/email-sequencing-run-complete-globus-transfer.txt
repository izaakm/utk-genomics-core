Hello,
The data from your recent sequencing run at the UT Genomics Core is now available via Globus. You should have received an email from Globus with instructions on accessing the results of your recent sequencing run.

The summary statistics for this sequencing run are in the "SummaryStatistics" subdirectory.

With Globus, you can transfer data directly to your local computer, UTK Google Drive, or UTK OneDrive. More details are available on our "Data Transfer on ISAAC-NG" page (URL below) in the sections about Globus.
